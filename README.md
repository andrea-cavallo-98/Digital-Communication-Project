# Digital-Communication-Project

The project is performed using `Matlab`.

The project consists of three parts:

* Build a numerical simulator to analyze a telecommunication system capable of transmitting an analog signal using a digital channel. Analyze both the effect of quantization and of digital channel (BSC) on the integrity of the signal.
* Build a numerical simulator to analyze M-PAM systems with antipodal symbols. Consider three possible modulation formats (2-PAM, 4-PAM and 8-PAM), three options for pulses (NRZ, RZ and SRRC) and two options for filters (matched, RC).
* Using Matlab implement a digital transmission system capable of sending a data file from one device (personal computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) to a PC using an audio signal.

The repository contains the code and the reports for the project.
